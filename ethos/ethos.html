        I am the person I am today because of my experiences, accomplishments,
        and failures. I bring these with me into every situation, believing they
        make me better. I find myself opinionated, as I believe one should be.
        My ethos can be broken down into three tenents: discipline, design, and
        deep work.

      <p>
        When I was younger, I used to think that motivation is what brought success.
        It was only after several failures that I recognized discipline is what
        brings about continued success.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, I had a
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545240/" target="_blank">
          <strong>
            Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
          </strong>
        </a>
        &#8599 which knocked me out of school for about three weeks. I came back
        to overdue work and nine missed exams, and initially caused me unbearable
        stress as I tried to catch up and recover. It was here, in this moment,
        that I realized discipline is the great differentiator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to come back from this event stronger than before because I
        no longer relied on motivation for success, but rather as a kickstart.
        What comes after is discipline, and it is what sees a project through.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following years, this mindset permeated into the rest of my life.
        Challenges were only difficult when I lapsed in my ability to break the
        problem down and attack them with discipline. I find the same today.

        I believe that there is beauty in all things. The world exudes beauty
        in all places, including man-made software. I have found that the medium
        of software is my art.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is inherent beauty is a well designed web. app. with beautiful animations
        and creative UI/UX. However, there is also something enthralling about
        a back-end solution that minimizes excess, prioritizes maintainability,
        and reduces wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        The culmination of this is no different than a beautiful

        Software that evokes emotion, inspires people to try new things, or
        even just makes a user's life easier is my calling. It blends contemporary
        technology with fundamental human desires. What could be more exciting
        than that?

        Deep Work
      </h3>
      <p>
        With the advent of short-form content, I found myself becoming increasingly
        distracted. I was unable to concentrate on my studies or projects for long
        periods, resulting in significantly worsened outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To combat this, I have tried to swing my personal pendulum in the opposite
        direction of the zeitgeist. I have removed as many distractions as possible,
        even physically locking my phone away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result? I can focus on what deeply matters to me for extended periods.
        I can retreat into my mind to think critically about complex problems.
        I work in a manageable and logical way, yielding predictable results.

        These are the tenets that make me distinctly me. I bring this underlying
        personal structure into every team, every project, and every opportunity.
        They shape my opinions, my thoughts, and my work. Without these pillars,
        I would be unguided and lost.
