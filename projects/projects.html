        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p id="experience">In my freetime, I love throwing together personal projects. I follow the motto of "move fast and break things" and I learn quickest when I have to fix something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="swiftlet">
        <h3>Swiftlet</h3>
        <p>I use the tool <a href="https://www.quizlet.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Quizlet</strong></a> &#8599; quite a bit, and I find it to be one of the study tools that is most helpful. However, it can be quite bloated as it is hindered by its web app nature.</p>
        <p>I wanted something faster, lighter, and easier to use, so I created <a href="https://gitlab.com/owen-mcgrath/Swiftlet" target="_blank"><strong>Swiftlet</strong></a> &#8599;, a stripped-down version of Quizlet, written entirely in Swift, and accessible via the CLI.</p>
        <p>This meant that users could create study sets quickly and with complete control over their content since each file is stored locally.</p>

    <div class="breathe">
        <h3>Breathe</h3>
        <p>I am a <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Raycast</strong></a> &#8599; power user, and when I realized there was the opportunity for user extension, I quickly started to toy around with it.</p>
        <p>My first foray into this was the <strong>Breathe</strong> extension, which provided users quick access to mindfulness meditation.</p>
        <p>Through Markdown, TypeScript, and a bit of hacking, I was able to show users a simple gif that guided them through breathing exercises.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="quotes">
        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>Some of my first API work was with <a href="https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction" target="_blank"><strong>quotable.io</strong></a> &#8599;, a simple but strong API that holds a massive repository of easily accessible quotes.</p>
        <p>I wanted Raycast users to be able to quickly get a variety of quotes right from their Spotlight search.</p>
        <p>A quick connection via this API allowed me to easily generate and regenerate quotes and format them with Markdown.</p>

    <div class="porsche">
        <h3>Porsche</h3>
        <p>If you read the brief introduction I gave, then you know that I adore cars. In particular, I adore all 80 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_(964)#:~:text=A%20total%20of%203%2C660%20964,was%20later%20increased%20to%2080." target="_blank"><strong>Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6 S</strong></a> &#8599;.</p>
        <p>However, due to their low production run and general heritage, they trade hands for around $1,000,000. Therefore, I wanted to understand if there was any chance for me to own an air-cooled 911.</p>
        <p>To do this, I scraped data from <a href="carsandbids.com" target="_blank"><strong>Cars&Bids</strong></a> &#8599; and used matplotlib and NumPy to create a graph of all sold air-cooled 911s.</p>
