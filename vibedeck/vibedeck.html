                This Privacy Policy describes how Built by Owen ("we," "us," or
                "our") handles information when you use our VibeDeck application
                (the "App"). Our App is designed to provide an interface for you
                to view and manage your Pinterest boards and pins using the
                Pinterest API.

                1. Information We Access via the Pinterest API
            </h3>
            <p>
                When you connect your Pinterest account to our App, we access
                certain information from your Pinterest profile solely as
                permitted by the Pinterest API and your Pinterest account
                settings. The information we access is limited to what is
                necessary to provide the core functionality of the App: allowing
                you to view your boards and pins and perform actions such as
                deleting or keeping them. This may include access to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Details of your boards and pins (e.g., images, descriptions,
                    links, board names).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Basic associated information about your Pinterest account
                    (like your username), only to the extent required to display
                    your content correctly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not collect or store your Pinterest password. The App acts
                primarily as a secure conduit to interact with your content on
                Pinterest's platform.

                    content).

                    similar technologies for analytics, advertising, or other
                    purposes.

                    Your location information (unless this is inherently part of
                    the Pinterest API data for specific pins/boards you view,
                    which is not directly collected by our App).

            <p>
                We use the information accessed through the Pinterest API
                strictly to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Display your Pinterest boards and pins within the App for
                    your viewing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enable you to manage your Pinterest content by initiating
                    actions (like deleting or keeping pins/boards) through the
                    App's interface, which are then processed by the Pinterest
                    API on your Pinterest account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improve the functionality and user experience of the App
                    specifically for these viewing and management tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not use the information accessed for marketing, selling,
                or any purpose other than facilitating your interaction with
                your Pinterest content as described above.

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">4. How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>
                Given the limited information we access and the App's specific
                function, we do not share the information accessed from your
                Pinterest account with any third parties or service providers
                for their own purposes. We would only disclose information if
                required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by
                public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency) or in
                connection with a business transfer (such as a merger or
                acquisition), where the information is part of the transferred
                assets.

                The security of your personal information accessed through the
                Pinterest API is handled primarily by Pinterest's platform.
                Within our App, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your
                interaction with the Pinterest API is secure. However, no method
                of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure.

                Your primary rights regarding your Pinterest data are governed
                by Pinterest's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Since
                our App only accesses and interacts with your data via the
