        <h2>Projects </h2>

        <p id="experience"> In my freetime, I love throwing together personal projects. I follow the motto of "move fast and break things" and I learn quickest when I have to fix something. </p>

    <div class = "swiftlet">

        <h3> Swiftlet </h3>

        <p> I use the tool <a href = "https://www.quizlet.com/" target = "_blank"> <strong> Quizlet </strong> </a> &#8599 quite a bit, and I find it to be one of the study tools that is most helpful. However, it can be quite bloated as it is hindered by its web app. nature </p>

        <p> I wanted something faster, lighter, and easier to use, so I created  <a href = "https://gitlab.com/owen-mcgrath/Swiftlet" target = "_blank"> <strong> Swiftlet </strong> </a> &#8599, a stripped down version of Quizlet, written entirely in Swift, and accessible via the CLI. </p>

        <p> This meant that users could create study sets quickly and with complete control over their content since each file is stored locally. </p>

        <h3> Breathe </h3>

        <p> I am a <a href = "https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank"> <strong> Raycast </strong> </a> &#8599 power user and when I realized there was the opportunity for user extension, I quickly started to toy around with it. </p>

        <p> My first foray into this was the <strong> Breathe </strong> extension which provided users quick access to mindfullness meditation. </p>

        <p> Through Markdown, TypeScript, and a bit of hacking, I was able to show users a simple gif that guided the user through breathing exercises. </p>

    <div class="quotes">

        <h3> Quotes </h3>

        <p> Some of my first API work was with <a href = "https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction" target="_blank"> <strong> quotable.io </strong></a> &#8599, a simple but strong API that holds a massive repository of easily accesible quotes. </p>

        <p> I wanted Raycast users to be able to quick get a variety of quotes right from their Spotlight search. </p>

        <p> A quick connection via this API allowed me to easy generate and regenerate quotes and format them with Markdown. </p>

    <div class = "porsche">

        <h3> Porsche </h3>

        <p> If you read the brief introduction I gave, then you know that I adore cars. In particular, I adore all 80 <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_(964)#:~:text=A%20total%20of%203%2C660%20964,was%20later%20increased%20to%2080." target="_blank"> <strong> Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6 S </strong> </a> &#8599. </p>

        <p> However, due to their low production run and general heritage, they trade hands for around $1,000,000. Therefore, I wanted to understand if there was any chance for me to own an air-cooled 911. </p>

        <p> To do this, I scraped data from <a href = "carsandbids.com" target="_blank"> <strong> Cars&Bids</strong> </a> &#8599 and used matplotlib and NumPy to create a graph of all sold air-cooled 911s. </p>
