          Hello, my name is Owen McGrath, and I am a junior studying BIA and Computer
          Science. I am in this course because it is a requirement to graduate with
          my degree in CS, but I am also interested in media and "content." I have
          very little experience in producing media, but I have quite a bit of experience
          in consuming it! I get a lot of my news from a magazine called
          <a href="https://monocle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Monocle,
          </a>
          which focuses on long-form journalism, and I get it as a monthly magazine.
          I also listen to their daily podcast, called the Monocle Briefing, which
          is a 45-minute podcast that covers the top news stories of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I try to be on my phone as little as possible, but it's a different story
          in regards to my laptop. I use my laptop for everything, but restrict my
          time on "fun" apps, (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) to past 8pm. This way, I am
          on track during the day, but I still get to feel connected to the "zeitgeist."
          I really do not like being so heavily online as I know it rots my brain,
          so I have taken strides to reduce my screen time. I have taken up reading,
          and I made it through nine books last year. I have also been trying to
          indulge in more classical forms of media, such as high quality films/TV.
          Right now, I am finishing up Silo and, next week, I will start watching
          Severance.
        </p>

          What really frustrates me about news media is just the sheer amount of
          information that is put out, and how much of it is just "slop." Recently,
          I have considered getting a print newspaper, just to try and avoid algorithmic
          news. However, what I think the news does really well is distilling information.
          There is so much that is being reported on, and the ability to take it
          and put it into an amount that does not overwhelm the reader is quite impressive.
          I also enjoy reporting where it feels conversational, which is why I lean
          into news podcasts.

          I am relatively experienced in programming, and I am probably headed upwards
          on the "slope of enlightenment" in the Dunning-Kruger effect.

          My favorite programming language is
          <a href="https://www.swift.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Swift,
          </a>
          and my dream job is to build the Swift programming language at Apple,
          Inc. I have held a couple of internships related to programming and technology,
          all of which have only furthered my interest in the field.
        </p>

          I am very concerned about a world that is so immersed in media. It feels
          like no one is really paying attention to anything anymore, myself included.
          I struggle to do one thing at a time, and I feel like I need background
          noise for everything. Only recently have I been able to fall asleep without
          any music or TV, which is heartbreaking. My whole life revolves around
          the digital world, as much as I am trying to escape it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recognize the benefits, but my outlook on technology and people's usage
          of it is bleak.
