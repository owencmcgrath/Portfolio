            <p>
                I used to be someone that was heavily online, consuming media from every angle. I was platform agnostic,
                and I would scroll anywhere with an infinite feed, whether that be Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Apple
                News, etc. These sites were all-consuming for me, and during this time period, I became more politically
                involved than the average sixteen-year-old should be. I was deep into the far left, and
                I experienced a social media bubble where content was served to me without any criticism, and opposing
                views were presented in such insane ways that they could never be realistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                My opinion was never challenged, my perspective never pushed back on. Often times, I would receive media
                that criticized me for not being far-left enough. Friends in my social circle were either entirely
                apolitical or in the same political range as I was, resulting in a vicious feedback loop of being
                "competitively left" just for the sake of being the most left.
            </p>
            <p>
                This culminated with my participation in a series of non-violent but still restless protests. At my last
                protest, I was almost arrested. This shock forced me to take a long, hard look at the choices that led
                me to this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had some difficult conversations with my parents, and they encouraged me to take part in a digital
                detox. After a month without my phone or online stimulus, the driving factors in my rapid descent into
                the radical left became apparent: it was largely social media and the content that I was consuming
                on these platforms. This period also gave me a chance to think about the issue at large, absent of
                myself. Today's social media platforms employ algorithms designed not to connect people with diverse
                perspectives but rather to maximize engagement by reinforcing existing beliefs—effectively pushing us
                into increasingly isolated ideological communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithms that control social media platforms have little incentive to push a narrative that
                challenges users' existing perspectives. I believe that people who describe social media bubbles as only
                providing aligning content are missing a crucial distinction: opposing viewpoints are indeed presented,
                but often as caricatures designed to trigger outrage rather than
                understanding. This framing reinforces users' existing beliefs by making alternative
                perspectives appear unreasonable. These digital ecosystems don't completely eliminate opposing
                viewpoints—they eliminate their most nuanced, compelling, and thoughtful representations, replacing them
                with versions that are easily dismissed or vilified.

                Accessible political conversation increasingly occurs within social media environments, where
                algorithms fail to challenge entrenched perspectives. These platforms promote inflammatory
                content to maximize user engagement and ad revenue. As Shankar
                Vedanatam of Hidden Brain observed on an <a

                    target="_blank"><strong> NPR podcast &#8599; </strong></a>:
                "There's a reason there is so much outrage out there. It's a very effective way to get your
                attention." When you feel outraged, a social media platform has a much easier time drawing you into
                their platform, making you more profitable as you see more ads and interact with more users.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deliberate choices by social media companies have led to an
                entirely divided political landscape where common ground has become increasingly rare. <a

                    target="_blank"><strong> The Pew Research Center &#8599; </strong></a> found that, during the 2020
                election, 89% of Republican voters said that if Joe Biden were to be elected, it would harm the country.
                90% of democratic voters held the same conviction but for incumbent Donald Trump. Each side has come to
                believe that their opposition is not simply misguided but existentially dangerous to the country's
                stability. When voters percieve each other as threatening, they are less likely to have substantive
                conversations about critical policy issues.

                The country's polarization is further exacerbated by the increasing erosion of trust in classical news
                media. In 2023, the
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-misinformation-polarization-coronavirus-media-d56a25fd8dfd9abe1389b56d7e82b873"
                    target="_blank"><strong> Associated Press &#8599;</strong></a> found that "Forty-five percent
                [of
                surveyed people] say they have little to no confidence at all [in the news media]." This "crisis of
                credibility" undermines the essential function of journalism: to provide citizens with clear and
                accurate information, necessary for the democratic process. When news organizations prioritize partisan
                narratives over factual reporting, they sacrifice their essential role as
                public informants.
            </p>

                Short of making all social media disappear with a snap and placing flip-phones into people's hands, my
                only suggestion is a return to face-to-face dialogue. Engaging with neighbors, community members,
                and those with political viewpoints in places an algorithm cannot reach strips away the digital
                distortions that can fuel polarization. When we converse directly, opposing perspectives transform from
                perceived threats into comprehensible viewpoints offered by fellow citizens with legitimate concerns.
                While this process may seem minuscule compared to sweeping technological reforms, it represents a
                practical first step towards rebuilding our civic infrastructure.

                So put down the phone, the social media, the Twitter, and the Reddit, and talk to someone who you know
                has a differing opinion than yours. Do not have the conversation with the purpose of converting them,
                but seek to understand them. These conversations aren't about overcoming the discomfort of these
                dialogues but whether or not our democracy can survive.
