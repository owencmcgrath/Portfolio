                    &#8599;, the story was about a hockey game where Canadian
                    fans booed the American anthem prior to the game starting
                    due to recent political tensions between the neighboring
                    countries. The three main articles for this Headline Roundup

                    Prior to analyzing these articles, it is important to
                    consider my own bias, in which I am incredibly left-leaning,
                    and therefore likely to be biased towards the left-leaning
                    sources. On almost all topics, I agree with liberal
                    politicians and have only ever voted in line with a liberal
                    ideology. Below is my political compass from
                    <a href="https://politicalcompass.org" target="_blank">

                    &#8599;, which attempts to measure political ideology on a
                    two-dimensional scale. The compass measures political
                    ideology on a left-right axis and a
                    libertarian-authoritarian axis. As is obvious, I sit on the
                    left extreme.

                    As for the articles themselves, each one spoke about the
                    events leading up to the game as well as during the game.
                    They also discussed the primary reason for the boos, which
                    comes from Trump's attempt to enforce 25% tariffs on Canada,
                    as well as potentially trying to make Canada the "51st
                    state."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both Newsweek and The New York Post elected to discuss what
                    happened on social media after the game, as well as who was
                    in attendance, with most quotes coming from X users. NBC, on
                    the other hand, elected to focus on the game itself, with no
                    quotes and no focus on social media. All of the sites failed
                    to link to external sources, unless they came from X. If
                    there was linkage, it was to stories that were written on
                    their own site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wording and tone of each site varied, but NBC seemed to
                    refrain from words of grandeur, while both Newsweek and The
                    New York Post used more interpretive language to describe
                    the events. For example, The New York Post wrote of
                    "handmade fireworks" to describe the fights during the game
                    or "torrential jeering" to describe the fans' reactions to
                    the National Anthem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, none of the sites provided any form of
                    verification or sources. While this story can be seen as
                    "light" or unserious, it's important to note that the lack
                    of verification and sources makes it difficult to determine
                    the accuracy of the claims made in the article. Most of the
                    quotes and descriptions were taken from social media, where
                    anyone can post, and posters rarely have to take
                    responsibility for their content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, it seems as though NBC had the most amount of
                    factual reporting and the least amount of bias, but Newsweek
                    was a close second. The New York Post used several metaphors
                    and colorful descriptions on a story that didn't need them.
                    This experiment taught me that each story, no matter how
                    light or unserious it may seem, should be treated with the
                    same level of scrutiny and verification as any other news
                    story. It's important to remember that even seemingly
                    trivial stories can have significant impacts on individuals
                    and society as a whole.
