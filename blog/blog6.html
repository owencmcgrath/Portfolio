                In my high school, a girl who I had grown up with and attended elementary and middle school with was
                recorded saying a racial slur in a way that was derogatory. She was riddiculed and labelled as
                "cancelled" ruining her life at our school with reprecussions in areas unrelated to our school. She
                quite literally fled the state, as her family were pressured to leave the school. She landed in Candada
                and, as far as I know, restarted her life, including attending univeristy there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heartbreaking part of this was that the recording was from years prior, when she was likely
                thirteen; old enough to know what she was saying, but not old enough to extrapolate the consequences
                that she would face for saying that word. In the years between her saying the slur and it being
                released, she took considerable steps to try and distance herself from this part of her past. She joined
                racial activism groups, spoke up for marginalized students, and organized rallies at the beginning of
                the modern BLM movement.

                Cancel culture is fast moving and nebulous, making it hard to put any concrete characteristics to it.
                The author and journalist
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Packer" target="_blank"><strong>
                        George Packard &#8599; </strong></a>
                described it to
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nfl-george-packer-media-football-social-media-9090804abf933c422207660509aeef22"
                    target="_blank"><strong> AP News &#8599; </strong></a>
                as "a mechanism where a chorus of voices,
                amplified on social media, tries to silence a point of view that they find offensive by trying to damage
                or destroy the reputation of the person who has given offense." I tend to agree with this definition.
                Prior to social media's inception, it was much harder to mobilize a group of people to attack one
                person. Cancel culture was a good faith idea that was warped into a much more harmful practice of
                removing anything that a party disagrees with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not against cancel culture in a classical form. The original instances of cancel culture brought
                people like Harvey Weinstien and Bill Cosby to justice for their crimes. People find strength
                in numbers, and in movements such as #metoo when women were encouraged to speak about their story. This
                worked well and several other movements were spawned from the success of #metoo. People realized that
                they could come together with a common goal and remove the power of an organization or person.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this is where the idea of cancel culture pivots from its classical stance of ousting bad people
                from power into a contemporary position where groups use cancel culture to attack an idea that they
                dislike. The most famous example of this is the Univerity of California Berkely (UC-Berkely) riots which
                happened in 2017 after conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was slated to speak on campus. Prior to
                the event, according to <a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/index.html"
                    target="_blank"><strong> CNN &#8599; </strong></a>, "more than 1,500 protesters had gathered at
                Sproul Plaza, chanting and holding signs that read: 'No safe space for racists' and 'This is war.'"
                After that, protests quickly turned into riots that would eventually cause $100,000 to the campus and
                surrounding downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
                These students at UC-Berkely which did not want Yiannopoulos to speak, opted to use cancel culture to
                ensure that he was unable to share his ideas on the campus. Instead of attempting to debate Yiannopoulos
                and try to disprove his arguments, the rioters refused to let any of his ideas be shared, preventing
                discussion and the progression thought that lies at the foundation of institutions like UC-Berkely.

                This incident is not isolated, with another conversative speaker's speech being cancelled at <a
                    href="https://apnews.com/article/education-california-university-of-701b6b4d5429305098405c7853787f5d"
                    target="_blank"><strong>University of California Davis &#8599;</strong></a> after students formed
                protests to have the speaker barred from campus.
