            <p>
                In my high school, a girl I had grown up with and attended elementary and middle school with was
                recorded saying a racial slur in a way that was derogatory. She was ridiculed and labeled as
                "cancelled," ruining her life at our school with repercussions in areas unrelated to our academics. She,
                quite literally, fled the state, as her family felt pressured to leave the school. She landed in Canada
                and, as far as I know, restarted her life, including attending university there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heartbreaking part of this was that the recording was from years prior, when she was likely
                thirteen; old enough to know what she was saying, but not old enough to extrapolate the consequences
                that she would face if the recording was published. In the years between her saying the slur and it
                being released, she took considerable steps to try and distance herself from this part of her past. She
                joined racial activism groups, spoke up for marginalized students, and organized rallies at the
                beginning of the modern BLM movement. This anecdote has had a deep personal effect on my approach to
                cancel culture, so I will focus solely on that topic in this blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cancel culture is fast-moving and nebulous, making it hard to put any concrete characteristics to it.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Packer" target="_blank"><strong>
                        George Packard &#8599; </strong></a>
                described it to
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nfl-george-packer-media-football-social-media-9090804abf933c422207660509aeef22"
                    target="_blank"><strong> AP News &#8599; </strong></a>
                as "a mechanism where a chorus of voices, amplified on social media, tries to silence a point of view
                that they find offensive by trying to damage or destroy the reputation of the person who has given
                offense." While this definition captures part of the phenomenon, cancel culture exists on a spectrum
                that demands our critical attention as media consumers and citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                While cancel culture emerged as a vital tool for collective accountability, it now demands critical
                media literacy skills to distinguish between justified consequences for harmful actions and the
                silencing of intellectual discourse. In our digital landscape where social media amplifies and
                accelerates public judgment, the ability to evaluate context, verify information, and consider diverse
                perspectives represents essential media literacy competencies that can transform how we engage with
                cancel culture phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not against cancel culture in its classical form. The original instances of cancel culture brought
                people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby to justice for their crimes. Social media provided a
                community for these affected women to speak about their stories, and movements like #metoo were spawned
                from the ability to speak out as a collective, rather than as individuals. This worked well, and several
                other movements were spawned from the success of #metoo. People realized that they could come together
                with a common goal and remove the power of an organization or person.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this is where the idea of cancel culture pivots from its classical stance of ousting bad people
                from power into a contemporary position where groups use cancel culture to attack an idea that they
                dislike. The most famous example of this is the University of California Berkeley (UC-Berkeley) riots
                which happened in 2017 after conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was slated to speak on campus. Prior
                to the event, according to <a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/index.html"
                    target="_blank"><strong> CNN &#8599; </strong></a>, "more than 1,500 protesters had gathered at
                Sproul Plaza, chanting and holding signs that read: 'No safe space for racists' and 'This is war.'"
                After that, protests quickly turned into riots that would eventually cause $100,000 in damage to the
                campus and surrounding downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
                This incident is not isolated, with another conservative speaker's speech being cancelled at <a
                    href="https://apnews.com/article/education-california-university-of-701b6b4d5429305098405c7853787f5d"
                    target="_blank"><strong>University of California Davis &#8599;</strong></a> after students formed
                protests to have the speaker barred from campus. These groups used their collective power to
                prevent a speaker whose ideas they disagreed with from talking at the university.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a media literacy perspective, these scenarios present complex challenges. When UC-Berkeley students
                prevented Yiannopoulos from speaking, they exercised a form of collective gatekeeping, deciding which
                ideas deserve public platforms. This approach bypasses the critical media literacy skill of evaluating
                content based on evidence, context, and reasoned analysis. The university, traditionally a space for
                intellectual exploration and ideological debate, instead became an environment where certain
                perspectives were deemed unworthy of engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core media literacy question becomes: how do we distinguish between necessary accountability and
                problematic censorship? Effective media literacy involves the ability to evaluate ideas based on their
                merits rather than silencing voices we disagree with. It requires analyzing context, critically
                examining information sources, and developing the capacity to engage with challenging perspectives
                without immediately rejecting them as dangerous or harmful.
