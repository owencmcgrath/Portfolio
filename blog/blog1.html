          One of the most important characteristics that humans possess is their attention and
          their ability to focus on things that matter to either the individual or the
          species as a whole. However, large social networking companies have spent
          hundreds of millions of dollars to capture and hold our attention because they
          understand how valuable it is. This is the basis of the attention economy, which
          can be defined as the commodification of human attention, which has always been
          important, but has been exacerbated by the rise of the internet and social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our everyday lives, the attention economy means that we are constantly bombarded with information
          so as to keep our attention. Whether it is intended to be malicious or not, companies understand how
          important it is to keep someone's attention. Take Instagram, for example. Meta, the parent company
          of Instagram, is a publically traded company, and the have a duty to their shareholders to make more
          money. Instagram makes money through consumers interacting with the app, specifically, viewing ads.
          The more time someone spends on Instagram, the more ads they see, and the more money Instagram makes.
          Therefore, Instagram has a vested interest in keeping the user's attention for as long as possible.
          One of the ways that Instagram has done this is to implement more addictive content that keeps the
          user engaged with the platform. This was done with the introduction of the Stories feature. This
          feature allowed users to post pictures and videos that would disappear after 24 hours, meaning that
          if you wanted to keep up to date with someone, you would have to check Instagram every day.

          This, paired with an "infinite-scroll" feed, has made it incredibly easy for users to open the app and
          get sucked into the platform for hours on end, viewing ads and making Meta's shareholders happy.

          We absolutely need to protect our attention and, under no circumstances, can we let tech. giants
          protect it for us. Currently, they are controlling our attention and there is no reason to assume
          that they can be trusted to pivot and protect it. We need to take back control of our attention,
          which I have actively tried to do by implementing a few strategies. I have turned off all notifications
          on my phone, and, on my laptop, I have paid for an app called <a href = "https://heyfocus.com" target="_blank"><strong>Focus</strong></a> &#8599;
          which is a website and application blocker that I have used to keep me on track. It is incredibly effective
          and my daily screen time has been reduced to minutes instead of hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that media multi-tasking is probably the most draining and damaging action that we
            can do to our attention. This idea can be described as <a href = "https://hbr.org/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications"><strong>context switching</strong></a> &#8599;, and it is the act of switching between projects or tasks of varying depths to another project or task.
            Not only does it reduce productivity, but it also reduces the quality of work that is being done,
            and it makes you feel more tired and less focused. I used to feel incredibly drained at the end
            of the week, but since I have stopped context switching so much, I have felt more energized and
            focused on my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the attention economy is a real, tangible thing that we need to be aware of. We need to
            take back control of our attention and not trust tech. giants to protect our attention. This can be
            done by reducing context switching and using tools to stay on track, or at least not sucked into social
            media.
