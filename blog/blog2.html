          I rarely feel overwhelmed by the number of emails or messages that I get,
          but I think that is entirely intentional. I never sign up for email newsletters
          unless I am convinced that I am interested in the content being shown.
          I also never give out my phone number unless I am sure that I am OK with
          the person contacting me. I have a very strict policy on who I let into
          my life, and that contributes to why I am not overwhelmed by hyperactive
          communication channels. It's important to note that I tell everyone to
          call me, instead of texting me, if they have something urgent to say. I
          find that people are less likely to call me, which is good, because I don't
          want to be bothered by constant notifications. I take pride in being unreachable
          via text/email. I also only check my email once a day, over lunch, which
          means that I am rarely overwhelmed by the number of emails that I get.

          Because of this, I don't want to turn it all off because it's as close
          to turned off as possible. I don't have that many social media connections,
          so I don't feel lost without them. I am entirely in love with my alone
          time, where I can sit and read, or code, or watch movies. I don't feel
          the need to be connected unless I am the one seeking the connection. I
          don't think that there's a middle ground; humans weren't made for constant
          connection, and I think everyone in the world would be a lot happier if
          they were to just ditch social media. The creator of

          &#8599;, Hayao Miyazaki, said it pretty well: “Modern life is so thin
          and shallow and fake. I look forward to when developers go bankrupt, Japan
          gets poorer, and wild grasses take over.”

          I hate to sound pretentious, but this challenge was not difficult for
          me. I spend such little time on my phone, already, that I just ended up
          reading a book that I had been working through recently. I also spent some
          time parsing through IBM's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing" target="_blank">

          &#8599; course, which is a subject that I am just infatuated with. I also
          cleaned out some junk drawers in my apartment.

          During this time, I was mostly thinking about how much I love my alone
          time and how much I love silence. I have also been mulling over some project
          ideas, so I got to flesh those out. I felt normal and just relaxed, which
          is something that I don't feel when I am connected to technology. This
          was a great opportunity for reflection, and I got to spend some time meditating
          as I began the challenge. All of this culminated to reinforce my abandonment
          of social media and my commitment to myself and my own well-being. I am
          so much happier without it, and I think that everyone should try to take
          a break from technology every once in a while, even if it's just for a
          day.
