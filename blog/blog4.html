                When I was younger, my father always read the Omaha World Herald's Sunday edition. Spending those hours
                with him, I quickly gained an understanding of how important journalism is to becoming an informed
                citizen, as it influenced how my father felt about local issues.
            </p>

                In my elementary school, teachers were encouraged to put on a program called <a
                    href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn10" target="_blank"><strong>CNN 10</strong> &#8599;</a> which is CNN's
                broadcast program dedicated to young teenagers. This was my first experience with "adult news," and it
                impacted my life by instilling news media as an important part of being an informed citizen.
            </p>
            <p>
                More recently, in my freshman year at Creighton, I wrote for the Creightonian and I was able to
                see the inner workings of a small, local newspaper with an impact on a community I care about.
                This, paired with a friend
                working at the <a href="https://flatwaterfreepress.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Flatwater Free Press
                        &#8599;</strong></a>, made me care deeply about small newspapers and their importance in
                fostering community engagement and accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, when we watched the 60 Minutes segment on local journalism and how much it is struggling, it
                worried me about the future of news. As of <a
                    href="https://www.closeup.org/the-decline-of-local-newspapers/" target="_blank"><strong>late 2024
                        &#8599;</strong></a>, two
                newspapers were shutting down every week, and
                the United States was on track to lose 1/3 of the newspapers that were open in 2005. This paints an
                incredibly bleak outlook for modern journalism. It appears that the current strategy of legacy
                journalism is not conducive to a successful business, with many outlets facing financial difficulties
                and reduced readership. However, through the adoption of innovative models for local journalism, we can
                hope for a brighter future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not alone in my concern about this issue, with <a
                    href="https://journalistsresource.org/media/business-model-journalism-social-media-nicco-mele/"
                    target="_blank"><strong>Nicco
                        Mele &#8599;</strong></a>
                of USC Annenberg warning, "<u>If the next three years look like the last three years
                    [2013-2016], I think we're going to look at the 50 largest metropolitan papers in the country and
                    expect somewhere between a third to a half of them to go out of business.</u>" This, paired with <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/bq2_wSsDwkQ?si=nLtOL1rTzILHRnIy&t=69" target="_blank"><strong>John Oliver's

                segment on local journalism and how much larger news organizations rely on their reporting, paints a
                bleak picture for all of the news media, not just smaller outlets. If larger news organizations are
                struggling to focus on substantive stories, instead choosing to focus on superfluous topics, while at
                the same time relying on local reporting for important stories, this endangers the future of the news
                industry.

                Traditionally, this part of the article would offer hope regarding the aforementioned issues. Yet,
                despite our
                research and conversations, I find myself without any clear solution - a sentiment echoed by leaders in
                the journalism space.
                Last year, the CEO of <a href="https://inn.org/" target="_blank"><strong>the
                        Institute
                        for Nonprofit News &#8599;</strong></a>, Karen Rundlet, and <a
                    href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/victor-pickard-phd" target="_blank"><strong>Victor
                        Pickard &#8599;</strong></a> of the University of Pennsylvania's journalism program went on an
                <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/victor-pickard-a-new-business-model-for-journalism"
                    target="_blank"><strong>Axios podcast &#8599;</strong> </a> to discuss the future of journalism.
                Their conclusion was sobering: with advertising revenue plummeting, decreased readership, and paywalls
                providing insufficient revenue, many have turned to the idea of "benevolent billionaires" as a final
                line of
                defense. "<u>And so if advertising isn't supporting journalism, paywalls aren't supporting journalism,
                    then many people think the so called benevolent billionaires will save us</u>," he explained.
                However, this "solution" comes with significant costs, as seen with Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post.
                Prior to the election of Donald Trump in 2024, the Washington Post planned to endorse rival candidate
                Kamala Harris. However, due to Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, that endorsement <a
                    href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations"
                    target="_blank">
                    <strong>never ran &#8599;</strong></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, amid the bleak outlook, the two journalism leaders did present an alternative that caught my
                attention: open-source journalism. Similar to how open-source software relies on community
                contributions, this model envisions citizens as active participants in the news-gathering process. They
                cite Chicago's <a href="https://www.citybureau.org/" target="_blank"><strong>City Bureau
                        &#8599;</strong></a> as
                a promising
                example: "<u>They're [City Bureau] training citizens and
                    paying them
                    to go to meetings, cover those meetings, take the notes, and partner with journalists to, to produce
                    written stories, audio stories, video stories.</u>"
            </p>
            <p>
                In software development, open-source software is a model where the source code is made available to the
                public for free, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute it. This model has been incredibly
                successful, with massive projects being handled by thousands of contributors. I believe that this
                collaborative approach could revitalize local journalism and enhance community engagement in ways
                traditional models
                cannot.
            </p>

                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F70jaEZnESXQ6SssU5uI4yO62JBz6xq2sNrrz8bW_ap2CuWUaQlbKs3j6NyRJnvcvYwAugkW8WzNJX21dZ2SMd9O_1TTpKZT-FsBkYSPy4rUSpJSo2C-WPTaLc2jQ8ancyj1TetXQ&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=e0c0e022c2ba776bd39b25d8a36b5242f09a29de9fed0598ebe85c2c653f88f2&ipo=images"

            </figure>
            <p>
                In this model, citizen journalists would cover stories that they find interesting and important and
                then report them to the repository of news information. This repository would be open to the public and
                accessible for anyone to contribute to and utilize, fostering a collaborative environment for news
                sharing. In my mind, this would work perfectly for local journalism, as it would allow for greater
                community involvement and transparency. When concerns about fact-checking arise—as they did during our
                class discussion—we can look to how the open-source
                software community handles similar challenges. In the software world, quality is maintained by a group
                of dedicated maintainers who review contributions before they're implemented. This same principle
                could be applied to
                local journalism, creating a system where experienced editors and community members collaboratively
                verify information, ensuring both accuracy and community representation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This model has already been successful at the aforementioned City Bureau, where they have trained
                citizens to actively participate in the news-gathering process. Their trained citizens then sit in on
                local
                government meetings, reporting on information that would otherwise remain uncovered. Their success
                demonstrates how open-source principles can effectively be applied to journalism in ways that both
                address the information needs of the underserved and create new pathways for civic engagement
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, while the current news media landscape looks bleak—with declining readership, financial
                challenges, declining local journalism creating news deserts, and diminishing accountability for local
                politicians—the open source model offers a promising alternative. By adapting principles from the
                technology world that have proven successful at scale, we can create a journalism ecosystem that fosters
                both community engagement and rigorous accountability, potentially addressing the core issues that
                traditional journalism models have failed to solve.
